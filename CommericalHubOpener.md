## Overview
The [Commerical Hub Opener)(CommericalHubOpener.md) is the default opener, and the most important of the [[Standard Openers]] to learn. It focuses on constructing commercial hubs and creating internal trade routes, which provide gold and food/production respectively.

## Rationale
Districts get more expensive as more techs are researched, so by rushing currency and minimizng techs researched, the 

## Priorities
When following this opener the following should be prioritized:
- Construct commercial hubs and markets in every city as soon as possible
- Use full trade route capacity for internal trade routes to the capital to increase food and production
- Use gold to buy buildings, traders, and get era score.
- Place the government plaza in whatever city you send your traders to to get +1 to food and production.
- Early on:
    - Settle inland, as coasts require extra techs to exploit, and harbors are far less useful since markets already provide trade route capacity
    - Try to settle on rivers, as commercial hubs placed next to them get +2 to their gold output

## Creating a Trade Capital
The city you send your internal trade routes to, shortened to "Trade Capital" for this article, is one of the most important parts of this opener. It will usually be your actual capital, since it is the easiest to build up. Increasing the yields of trade routes to this city increases the stats of your entire empire. There are two ways to increase these yields: building districts, and governor promotions.

### District Bonuses
Breaking down districts by benefits to internal trade routes:
- Production: Encampment, Commercial Hub, Harbor, Industrial Zone, Aerodrome
- Food: Campus, Holy Site, Preserve, Theater Square, Entertainment Complex, and Water Park
- Food and Production: Government Plaza and Diplomatic Quarter

Due to the extremely good bonuses for government plaza and diplomatic quarter, try to place both in your trade capital. Moreover, to hit the population requirements for districts sooner, try to create food-increasing tile improvements in your trade capital.

### Governor Promotions
Magnus or Moksha both offer excellent buffs to internal trade routes. Pingala also has a bonus to internals that **you should not use**.
- Magnus: Surplus Logistics buffs food and production on trade routes to his city by one. 
- Moksha: Divine Architect increases food by 1, and culture by 2, but requires an gov title.
- Pingala: Shared Knowledge increases food by 1, and science by 3. **Don't use this unless you know what you're doing**

More information can be found on the [[Governors]] page.

## Golden Age
Classical:
- Pen, Brush and Voice should always be selected first, as this helps rush Feudalism.

Medieval:
- Free Inquiry is standard for the boost to techs. To get the full benefit from the science granted by gold adjacency, use the Town Charters policy card granted by the Guilds civic to double gold adjacency.

Renaissance and Later:
- After this point golden ages are very situational. Check the [[Golden Age]] page for more.

## Tech Pathing
For this opener, the focus should be on rushing Currency (which unlocks com hubs) as soon as possible, route shown below.

### Eurekas
Meet another civilization: Send your starter barbarian and scout far away to find another civ.
Make a [[Trade Route]]: Rush Foreign Trade in the civic tree, then buy a trader in your second city to send to your capital.

### Extra Notes
- A detour can be taken for Irrigation, Animal Husbandry, or Mining to get three tile improvements, triggering the inspiration for Craftsmanship
- If no coastal cities are settled, avoid celestial navigation and astrology entirely, as researching them makes [[District Discounting]] harder, and the tech tree can be completed without them.
- After researching currency and a tile-improvement granting tech, try to rush Apprenticeship to increase the production of mines in the [[Midgame]].

## Civic Pathing
The commercial hub opener only depends on hitting a single civic earlier than usual: Foreign Trade. This unlocks traders, a key part of the commercial hub opener. Unlike the techs, however, it is acceptable to delay foreign trade to take craftsmanship, as it generally will still be done before you begin increasing your trade route capacity by constructing markets in your commercial hubs.

### Inspirations
Discover a second continent: Like meet another civilization, this can be achieved by simply sending units to explore far from your spawn.

### Extra notes
- The bottom half of the tree starting with Mysticism can be delayed until the envoys or wonders are needed
- Naval tradition can be skipped entirely
- Guilds should be prioritized after feudalism for the +100% gold adjacency given by the Town Charters policy card. This is key to maximizing the science granted by a Free Inquiry golden age.
