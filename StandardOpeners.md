[[Standard Openers]] are built around creating powerful cities that can build a lot of stuff, a process called [[scaling|Scaling]]. In the early game this means maximizing four key resources: [[Food]], [[Production]], [[Gold]]/[[Faith]], and [[Culture]]. Information on why these resources are important can be found on the [[Early Game]] page.

A [Commerical Hub Opener](CommericalHubOpener.md), [[Harbor Opener]], and [[Holy Site Opener]]. New players should stick to the [Commerical Hub Opener].(CommericalHubOpener.md) and [[Harbor Opener]], as these are far easier to learn and require less consideration for civ-specific bonuses compared to the [[Holy Site Opener]]. Information on how each opener plays can be found on their specific pages.

For the first city, the [[Build Order]] is to construct two scouts, followed by two settlers. This is typically followed by a monument, for culture, or a builder, to construct three tile improvements. This is the standard build order for each opening unless otherwise stated.
